# Inventory_Tracker

The company I currently work for did not have a way of managing inventory. I created this simple Python GUI program using Tkinter to make a simple application 
where I could keep track of assigned devices.

It uses a back-end sqlite3 database that is created upon first use and is stored on your local machine.

I used Pyinstaller to create an executable.
